# OS Project1 - Multi threading chat room can provide grop chat service

In this project, we use multi threading to handle the connection requests from clients and receive the messages that come from other clients. Also, we use socket programing to establish the connection (TCP).
What's more, we prevent the signal that terminate the process (Ctrl-C in server) from accidently closing the process using signal handler.
